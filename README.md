## 🤓 About me
![Kim Jisena Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/kimjisena/badges/large)

I'm Jisena, a community-taught frontend developer. I've spent the best part of my life conjuring ghouls and daemons hidden deep in my computer.

It's been both an exciting journey and a humbling experience. 
I have witnessed processes give birth to other processes only to end up killing them both. 
I have read hundreds of manual pages only to be referred to other huge and almost cryptic manuals.

It's an infinite loop that I enjoy living, and I intend to keep it that way for as long as my heart keeps its beat.

## 🛠️ Skills
Here are some tools that commonly cross my hands on (almost) a day to day basis.
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- Redux
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- NodeJS
- C
- Bash
- Git
## 🔥 Interests
I'm currently investing more time in frontend development partly because it's very accessible and feedback is immediate.

Additionally, I'm interested in:
- Open source projects
- Robotics
- Operating systems
- Distributed computing

## 💜 Hobbies
- I spend most of my active time writing computer code, reading computer code, reading books on computer code and wrestling with my Linux box (probably I should get a life).
- I like everything tech. I know this because I never get enough of it and no matter how many interests I develop, tech always comes first.
- I enjoy reading books (fiction and non-fiction).
- Language is another phenomenon that never ceases to amaze me. I'm currently acquiring Spanish.
- I enjoy both ancient and contemporary history. Humanity has come a long way and history tells the best of humanity's stories.
